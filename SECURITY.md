# Security Policy

## Security Philosophy

The Redmine MCP Server project's security approach is built on the principle of "Security Through Process." We believe that consistent, well-documented processes provide a foundation for security by reducing human error and ensuring thorough validation at every step.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability within the Redmine MCP Server, please follow these steps:

1. **Do Not** disclose the vulnerability publicly
2. Send a detailed report to the project maintainers
3. Include as much information as possible, including:
   - Steps to reproduce the vulnerability
   - Potential impact of the vulnerability
   - Suggested mitigations if available
4. Allow time for the vulnerability to be addressed before any public disclosure

## Security Processes

### Development Security

All development work follows these security practices:

1. **Documentation First**: All changes are documented before implementation
2. **Validation Gates**: All changes must pass through validation before being accepted
3. **Evidence-Based Progress**: All changes must have supporting evidence
4. **One Task at a Time**: Focus on a single task ensures thorough attention to security details
5. **Code Review**: All code changes undergo review with a security focus
6. **Testing**: Comprehensive testing includes security-focused tests

### Operational Security

The operational security of the Redmine MCP Server relies on:

1. **TLS Encryption**: All communications must use TLS encryption
2. **Authentication**: All requests must be properly authenticated
3. **Authorization**: Access control is enforced for all operations
4. **Input Validation**: All input is validated before processing
5. **Logging**: Comprehensive logging for security audit purposes
6. **Monitoring**: Regular monitoring for security anomalies

## Security Requirements

The Redmine MCP Server has the following security requirements:

1. **Authentication and Authorization**
   - All API requests must be authenticated
   - Proper authorization must be verified for all operations
   - Sensitive data must be handled according to best practices

2. **Data Protection**
   - Data in transit must be encrypted using TLS 1.2 or higher
   - API keys and credentials must be securely stored
   - Input validation must be implemented for all data

3. **Vulnerability Management**
   - Regular vulnerability scanning must be performed
   - Security patches must be applied promptly
   - Security headers should be implemented

## Security Validation

All components undergo security validation including:

1. **Code Review**: Security-focused code review
2. **Vulnerability Scanning**: Automated scanning for known vulnerabilities
3. **Penetration Testing**: Regular testing for security weaknesses
4. **Dependency Checking**: Monitoring of dependencies for security issues
5. **Process Audit**: Verification of security process adherence

## Security Updates

Security updates will be handled as follows:

1. **Critical Vulnerabilities**: Addressed immediately with direct notification to users
2. **High Severity**: Addressed in the next release with security advisories
3. **Medium and Low Severity**: Addressed according to the project roadmap

## Security Documentation

All security documentation is maintained within the project repository:

1. **Security Requirements**: Detailed in the requirements documentation
2. **Security Architecture**: Outlined in the architecture documentation
3. **Security Procedures**: Documented in the procedures documentation
4. **Security Validation**: Tracked in the validation documentation

Remember: Process is the key and provides security through repetition. How slowly you work is an indication of how careful you are.
