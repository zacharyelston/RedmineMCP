2. **Documentation Enhancement**
   - Create comprehensive API documentation
   - Add more usage examples for different scenarios
   - Improve troubleshooting guide with common issues

3. **Error Handling Refinement**
   - Implement retry mechanism for transient API errors
   - Add circuit breaker pattern for failure scenarios
   - Improve user-facing error messages for clarity

## Medium-Term Goals

4. **Feature Expansions**
   - **File Attachments**: Support for issue attachments
   - **Time Tracking**: Add time entry management
   - **Custom Fields**: Support for Redmine custom fields
   - **Wiki Integration**: Access to Redmine wiki contents
   - **User Management**: Enhanced user operations

5. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Implement caching for frequently accessed resources
   - Add connection pooling for API requests
   - Optimize parameter handling and validation

6. **Security Enhancements**
   - Add input sanitization for all parameters
   - Implement rate limiting for API requests
   - Add robust authentication options

## Long-Term Vision

7. **Extended MCP Protocol Support**
   - Keep up with MCP protocol updates
   - Contribute to MCP protocol standards
   - Create adapter layer for different MCP clients

8. **Advanced Analytics**
   - Add aggregated reporting capabilities
   - Implement data visualization support
   - Create dashboard integration for monitoring

9. **Enterprise Features**
   - Multi-tenant support for large organizations
   - LDAP/SSO integration
   - Compliance and audit logging

## Technical Debt & Maintenance

10. **Code Quality**
    - Ongoing refactoring for modularity
    - Comprehensive inline documentation
    - Code style standardization

11. **Dependency Management**
    - Regular updates of dependencies
    - Security vulnerability scanning
    - Compatibility testing with newer Node.js versions

## Community & Adoption

12. **User Experience**
    - Detailed usage guides for non-technical users
    - Improved response formatting for readability
    - Sample scripts and commands for common workflows

13. **Community Building**
    - Create contribution guidelines
    - Set up community discussions
    - Establish regular release cycle

## Implementation Approach

For all future development, we'll continue to follow these principles:

1. **Focus on One Task at a Time**
   - Complete and validate each feature before moving to the next
   - Work methodically and carefully to minimize errors

2. **Robust Testing**
   - Every new feature must include comprehensive tests
   - Regression testing for existing functionality

3. **Documentation First**
   - Update documentation before or alongside code changes
   - Ensure examples are accurate and helpful

4. **Security by Design**
   - All new features are evaluated for security implications
   - Parameter validation at all levels of interaction

5. **Backwards Compatibility**
   - Maintain compatibility with existing Claude implementations
   - Provide migration paths for any breaking changes
