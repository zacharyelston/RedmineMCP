# Role-Based MCP Server Configuration - TODO Next Steps

## Summary of Progress

We've designed a framework for role-based MCP server instances with the following components:

1. YAML configuration format for defining role properties including:
   - Permissions
   - Custom fields
   - Behavioral patterns
   - MCP server configuration

2. YAML to SQL conversion system:
   - Role creation SQL
   - User setup SQL
   - Custom fields SQL
   - Project membership SQL

3. MCP server configuration generators:
   - Setup shell scripts
   - Environment files
   - Role-specific configuration files

4. Sample role configurations:
   - Developer role
   - Project Manager role

## Immediate Next Tasks

### 1. Complete the Core YAML to SQL Conversion System

- [ ] Install dependencies:
  ```bash
  cd modules/roles-sync
  npm install
  ```

- [ ] Create output directory:
  ```bash
  mkdir -p sql-output
  ```

- [ ] Test the YAML validation with sample files:
  ```bash
  node yaml_to_sql.js --validate --config ./samples
  ```

- [ ] Generate SQL and setup scripts from samples:
  ```bash
  node yaml_to_sql.js --config ./samples --output ./sql-output
  ```

- [ ] Review the generated SQL files for correctness

### 2. Integrate with MCP Server

- [ ] Create directory for role-specific MCP server code:
  ```bash
  mkdir -p ../../src/core/roles
  ```

- [ ] Implement the `RoleConfigLoader.ts` class as outlined in the implementation plan
- [ ] Implement the `RoleBasedMcpServer.ts` class that extends the base MCP server
- [ ] Update server startup code to support role-based initialization

### 3. Test Role-Based Operation

- [ ] Create a test Redmine database with sample roles
- [ ] Apply the generated SQL scripts to create roles and users
- [ ] Start a role-specific MCP server instance
- [ ] Test command execution with role-specific permissions
- [ ] Validate behavioral pattern application

### 4. Create Additional Role Configurations

- [ ] QA/Tester role configuration
- [ ] Documentation Specialist role configuration
- [ ] DevOps Engineer role configuration

### 5. Document the System

- [ ] Create comprehensive documentation for the role-based system
- [ ] Add instructions for creating new roles
- [ ] Document integration with Claude Desktop

## Design Considerations

### One MCP Server Instance Per Role

The main insight from our design is that each role (Developer, Project Manager, etc.) should have:

1. Its own dedicated MCP server instance running on a separate port
2. A unique API key for authentication
3. A specific set of available tools and commands
4. Role-appropriate behavioral patterns

This approach provides clean separation between roles and prevents permission escalation issues.

### Integration with Claude

Claude agents will connect to the specific MCP server instance that corresponds to their assigned role. This ensures that:

1. Claude can only access tools and commands appropriate for its role
2. Claude's behavior (communication style, focus areas, etc.) aligns with role expectations
3. Custom fields provide role-specific context and capabilities

### SQL Generation Strategy

The SQL generation strategy focuses on:

1. Creating role definitions in Redmine
2. Setting up role-specific users with proper API keys
3. Adding custom fields that provide context for the role
4. Creating appropriate project memberships

All SQL operations use transactions to ensure data integrity and include checks to prevent duplicate creation.

## Questions to Resolve

1. How should we handle multiple instances of the same role? (e.g., multiple Developer instances)
2. Should we implement a master controller to coordinate between role-based instances?
3. What's the optimal storage location for role-specific logs and data?
4. How do we handle role transitions or multi-role scenarios?

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be successful when:

1. We can generate and apply SQL for different roles
2. The MCP server instances properly enforce role-based permissions
3. Claude's behavior appropriately reflects the assigned role
4. The system is documented and easy to extend with new roles

## Next Steps for Implementation

Focus on completing the YAML to SQL conversion system first, then move on to the MCP server integration. This phased approach will allow us to validate each component before moving to the next stage.
