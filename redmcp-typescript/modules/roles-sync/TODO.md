# Role-Based MCP Server Configuration

## Overview

This feature will allow different AI agents to connect to role-specific MCP server instances, each with tailored behaviors, permissions, and focus areas. By creating role-specific profiles that map to Redmine roles, we can create specialized AI workers with appropriately scoped access and behavioral patterns.

## Goals

- Create a system where each Redmine role has a corresponding MCP server configuration
- Define role profiles in YAML that describe permissions, focus areas, and behavioral patterns
- Generate SQL scripts from YAML configs to initialize Redmine with proper user/group/field setups
- Provide a build script to convert YAML configs into SQL initialization scripts
- Document the process for setting up role-specific AI workers

## Tasks

### 1. YAML Configuration System

- [ ] Design YAML schema for role definitions
- [ ] Create sample YAML configurations for common roles:
  - [ ] Developer role
  - [ ] Project Manager role
  - [ ] QA role
  - [ ] Product Owner role
  - [ ] Documentation Specialist role
- [ ] Define standard fields that apply to all roles
- [ ] Define role-specific custom fields
- [ ] Create validation mechanism for YAML configs

### 2. YAML to SQL Converter

- [ ] Research Redmine database schema for users, groups, roles, and custom fields
- [ ] Develop script to convert YAML role configs to SQL scripts
- [ ] Add support for:
  - [ ] Creating roles with appropriate permissions
  - [ ] Setting up user groups
  - [ ] Defining custom fields for each role
  - [ ] Setting default values
- [ ] Include transaction support for rollback capability
- [ ] Add validation checks in generated SQL
- [ ] Create test framework for SQL generation

### 3. MCP Server Role-Based Configuration

- [ ] Extend MCP server to support role-based configurations
- [ ] Create configuration mechanism for role-specific behavior
- [ ] Implement role-based access control for MCP tools
- [ ] Define behavioral patterns for different roles
- [ ] Develop mechanism to load role configuration at startup

### 4. Role-Based Claude Agent Configuration

- [ ] Create documentation for setting up role-specific Claude instances
- [ ] Develop sample configuration for Claude Desktop per role
- [ ] Create role-specific initial prompts for different AI workers
- [ ] Define common "team practices" across roles
- [ ] Document how roles interact with each other

### 5. Integration and Testing

- [ ] Create automated testing for role-based permission validation
- [ ] Develop test scenarios for multi-role workflows
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline extensions for role config testing
- [ ] Create sample multi-role project demonstrations

## Implementation Details

### YAML Configuration Format

```yaml
# Example YAML structure for role configuration
role:
  name: "Developer"
  description: "Technical role focused on code implementation and technical solutions"
  permissions:
    - view_issues
    - add_issues
    - edit_issues
    - add_issue_notes
    - view_private_notes
    - set_issues_private
    - manage_issue_relations
    - manage_subtasks
    - view_roadmap
    - manage_repository
    - commit_access
    
  custom_fields:
    - name: "expertise_areas"
      type: "list"
      possible_values:
        - "Frontend"
        - "Backend"
        - "Database"
        - "DevOps"
      default_value: ""
      is_required: false
      
    - name: "code_review_focus"
      type: "list"
      possible_values:
        - "Performance"
        - "Security"
        - "Maintainability"
        - "Testability"
      default_value: "Maintainability"
      is_required: true
  
  behavioral_patterns:
    focus_areas:
      - "Code quality"
      - "Testing coverage"
      - "Technical documentation"
      - "Architecture considerations"
    
    communication_style:
      formality: "medium"
      technical_depth: "high"
      code_examples: "frequent"
      
    decision_making:
      autonomy_level: "high on technical details, medium on architectural decisions"
      escalation_threshold: "When architectural changes are needed or when requirements are unclear"
```

### SQL Generation Script

The script should:
1. Parse YAML configuration files
2. Map YAML structures to Redmine database schema
3. Generate SQL for:
   - Role creation
   - Permission assignments
   - Custom field definitions
   - Default values
4. Handle dependencies between database objects
5. Include foreign key constraints and validation

### Integration with MCP Server

The MCP server should:
1. Load role configuration at startup
2. Filter available tools based on role permissions
3. Adjust behavior based on role's behavioral patterns
4. Log actions with role context for traceability

## Future Extensions

- Role-based analytics dashboard
- AI coaching for roles (e.g., AI managers helping AI developers)
- Cross-role collaboration workflows
- Role performance metrics
- Automated role optimization based on project outcomes
