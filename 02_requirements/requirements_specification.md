# Redmine MCP Integration Requirements Specification

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This document outlines the requirements for integrating the Model Context Protocol (MCP) with Redmine, enabling AI assistants to interact with Redmine data and functionality in a standardized way.

### 1.2 Scope
The integration will create an MCP server that provides access to Redmine data through resources, tools, and prompts as defined in the MCP specification. This will allow AI assistants to understand project context, retrieve information, and take actions within Redmine.

### 1.3 Definitions and Acronyms
- **MCP**: Model Context Protocol
- **REST API**: Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface
- **LLM**: Large Language Model
- **JSON**: JavaScript Object Notation
- **XML**: Extensible Markup Language

## 2. System Description

### 2.1 System Context
The RedmineMCP integration will act as a bridge between AI assistants and Redmine. It will implement the MCP server specification to expose Redmine data and functionality to AI models in a standardized way.

### 2.2 System Overview
The system will consist of an MCP server that connects to Redmine via its REST API. The server will expose Redmine resources, provide tools for interacting with Redmine, and offer prompt templates for common tasks.
