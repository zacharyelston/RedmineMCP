{"issue":{"estimated_hours":16,"notes":"After analyzing the codebase, I've identified key areas for improvement: (1) API client error handling in redmine_api.py and llm_api.py needs more specific error types (2) We should implement a fallback mode when APIs are unavailable (3) For the error logging view, we can add a new route under /admin/logs with filtering capabilities. I'll focus on implementing these changes over the next two weeks."}}
