# Redmine MCP Migration Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the migration process for the Redmine MCP implementation and provides troubleshooting steps for potential authentication issues.

## Migration Steps Completed

1. **User Account Creation:**
   - Created admin, testuser, developer, and manager accounts
   - Generated API keys for each user
   - Added email addresses for the users

2. **Project Configuration:**
   - Created the MCP project
   - Configured project modules and trackers
   - Set up issue categories

3. **Role Creation:**
   - Created Developer, Manager, and Reporter roles
   - Configured permissions for each role

4. **User-Project Role Assignment:**
   - Assigned users to appropriate roles within the MCP project

## Verification Results

Database verification confirms that:
- Users were created successfully
- API keys were generated and stored in the database
- Project and roles were created properly

However, API testing indicates that:
- API authentication isn't working as expected
- Even basic authentication with username/password isn't working

## Possible Issues & Troubleshooting Steps

1. **Redmine Configuration:**
   - Confirm REST API is enabled in Redmine settings (verified)
   - Check if API key authentication is properly configured

2. **Authentication Format:**
   - Try different authentication methods (header vs query parameter)
   - Example: `curl -v "http://localhost:3000/users/current.json?key=admin_api_key"`

3. **Password Format:**
   - The password hash format might not be correct
   - Redmine may be using a different hashing algorithm

4. **Container Configuration:**
   - Check if the containers are properly connected and can communicate
   - Verify that port forwarding is working correctly

5. **Redmine Version Compatibility:**
   - Check if the current Redmine version (5.0) has a different API authentication mechanism

## Next Steps

1. **Access via Web Interface:**
   - Try accessing Redmine via web browser at http://localhost:3000
   - Login with admin/admin and check if basic functionality works

2. **Reset Admin Password:**
   - Use Redmine's password reset functionality
   - Follow instructions in the Redmine documentation

3. **Check Redmine Logs:**
   - Examine the Redmine logs for authentication errors
   - Example: `docker logs redmine-app`

4. **Restart Containers:**
   - Restart the Redmine and PostgreSQL containers
   - Example: `docker-compose restart redmine-app redmine-postgres`

5. **Apply Additional Migrations:**
   - If needed, create additional migration scripts to fix authentication
   - Consider resetting the admin password using Redmine's built-in tools

## Using Test Scripts

The following scripts have been created to assist with migrations and testing:

- `/redmine-mcp/scripts/apply-migrations.sh`: Applies all migration steps in order
- `/redmine-mcp/scripts/verify-migrations.sh`: Verifies the API connectivity
- `/redmine-mcp/scripts/test-redmine-api.sh`: Tool for testing individual API endpoints

## API Keys (For Future Testing)

```
Admin:     admin_api_key
Test User: test_api_key
Developer: dev_api_key
Manager:   manager_api_key
```

## Conclusion

The database migrations have been successfully applied, creating users, projects, roles, and relationships. However, API access is currently not working as expected. This could be due to configuration issues with Redmine or the Docker environment. Further troubleshooting is needed to resolve these authentication issues.
