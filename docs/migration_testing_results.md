# Redmine MCP Migration Testing Results

## Overview

This document summarizes the testing results of the Redmine MCP migration process. The migrations have been applied successfully, but there are still some issues with API authentication.

## What's Working

1. **Database Migrations**:
   - User accounts have been created successfully
   - Project has been created with proper nested set values
   - Trackers are properly configured
   - Issue statuses and workflows are set up
   - Roles are properly defined
   - User-project role assignments are configured

2. **Redmine Web Interface**:
   - Redmine is accessible at http://localhost:3000
   - The web interface returns a 200 status code

## Issues Encountered

1. **API Authentication**:
   - Both API key and basic authentication attempts return 401 Unauthorized
   - This suggests there might be an issue with Redmine's authentication configuration

2. **Container Health**:
   - The Redmine container was initially marked as "unhealthy"
   - After applying the migrations, the container is now running but may still have configuration issues

## Potential Solutions

1. **Authentication Configuration**:
   - Check if the admin password needs to be reset from the web interface
   - Verify that the REST API setting is properly enabled in the Redmine interface
   - Check Redmine's configuration files for any authentication-related settings

2. **Container Configuration**:
   - Inspect Redmine's container logs in detail
   - Check for any additional environment variables that may need to be set

3. **Database Schema**:
   - Verify that the token values in the database match the expected format
   - Check if there are additional schema updates needed

## Next Steps

1. **Web Interface Exploration**:
   - Log in to Redmine web interface with admin credentials
   - Verify that users, projects, and trackers are visible
   - Manually enable REST API if needed

2. **API Testing**:
   - Try generating a new API key through the web interface
   - Test with the new API key

3. **Documentation**:
   - Update documentation with current status
   - Add troubleshooting section for API authentication issues

## Conclusion

The database-level migrations appear to be successful, but there are still issues with API authentication. This may require manual intervention through the Redmine web interface to resolve.

Despite these issues, the core configuration of users, projects, trackers, and workflows appears to be correct in the database, which is a significant step forward.
