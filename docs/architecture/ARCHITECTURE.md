## 4. Data Flow

### 4.1 Client Request Flow

1. Client sends MCP message to API endpoint
2. Server authenticates and authorizes request
3. Router directs to appropriate handler
4. Protocol handler validates message
5. Command handler processes message
6. Redmine integration layer performs necessary Redmine operations
7. Response flows back through layers
8. Server returns response to client

### 4.2 Data Storage Flow

1. Incoming data validated by schema validator
2. Data mapped to appropriate internal structure
3. Data persistence handled by Redmine integration
4. Cached as appropriate for performance
5. Changes synchronized with Redmine

## 5. Security Architecture

### 5.1 Authentication Flow

1. Client provides authentication credentials
2. Server validates credentials against Redmine
3. Server issues authentication token
4. Client includes token in subsequent requests
5. Server validates token on each request

### 5.2 Authorization Model

1. Permissions based on Redmine roles
2. Resources protected by role-based access control
3. Operations require specific permissions
4. Authorization enforced at multiple layers

### 5.3 Data Protection

1. All communication over TLS
2. Sensitive data encrypted at rest
3. Credentials never logged
4. Input validation prevents injection attacks

## 6. Deployment Architecture

### 6.1 Container Architecture
