# Redmine MCP Project Bootstrap Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the steps taken to bootstrap a fresh Redmine and MCP server environment after data loss in the previous installation.

## Created Resources

### 1. Bootstrap Script
- **Location**: `/redmine-mcp/scripts/bootstrap-redmine-mcp.sh`
- **Purpose**: Automates the complete setup of both Redmine and MCP servers
- **Features**:
  - Configures MCP to connect to Redmine
  - Handles environment preparation
  - Starts all necessary containers
  - Verifies connectivity
  - Includes fallback mechanisms for common issues

### 2. Documentation
- **Location**: `/redmine-mcp/docs/REDMINE_MCP_SETUP.md`
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive guide to setup and management
- **Contents**:
  - Quick start instructions
  - Manual setup procedures
  - Troubleshooting guidance
  - Best practices for MCP protocol usage

## Implementation Approach

Following MCP best practices, we took a methodical approach:

1. **Analysis of Current Configuration**
   - Examined the redmine-server Docker Compose file
   - Identified MCP server configuration needs
   - Determined the simplest networking approach

2. **Simple, Direct Solution**
   - Used host network mode for direct communication
   - Configured MCP to connect to localhost:3000
   - Included fallback to host.docker.internal for compatibility

3. **Validation Steps**
   - Connectivity checks between services
   - Health checks for both Redmine and MCP
   - Automated error detection and correction

## Using the New Environment

To bootstrap the environment:

```bash
bash /redmine-mcp/scripts/bootstrap-redmine-mcp.sh
```

After running the script:
1. Access Redmine at http://localhost:3000
2. Generate a new API key in Redmine
3. Update the MCP configuration with the new key
4. Restart the MCP server

## Next Steps

1. **Initial Redmine Configuration**
   - Set up projects, users, and workflows
   - Configure custom fields and issue types

2. **MCP Integration**
   - Test MCP protocol commands
   - Develop automation workflows
   - Document custom MCP implementations

3. **Backup Strategy**
   - Implement regular database backups
   - Document recovery procedures

This solution follows the ModelContextProtocol principles of working methodically on one task at a time, validating before moving forward, and maintaining clear documentation of the process.
