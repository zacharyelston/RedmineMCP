# Simple Solution for Redmine MCP Connection

## Issue Overview
The MCP server is failing to connect to the Redmine server with the error message:
```
Failed to connect to Redmine at http://localhost:3000
```

## Root Cause
The issue is simply that the Redmine server is running at localhost:3000, but there might be a network configuration issue preventing the MCP server from accessing it properly.

## Simplest Solution

The simplest approach is to:

1. **Ensure Redmine is running and accessible** on port 3000
2. **Verify MCP server is using host networking** (it already is)
3. **Update the configuration to use the correct URL**

### Why This Is Simple
- It makes minimal changes to the configuration
- It doesn't introduce new Docker networks
- It doesn't require host file modifications
- It uses the existing network setup

## Implementation Steps

1. **Verify Redmine is running:**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/zacelston/CODE/MCPZ/redmine1/
   docker-compose ps
   ```

2. **If needed, start the Redmine server:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. **Apply the simple MCP configuration:**
   ```bash
   cp /redmine-mcp/mcp-server/config/config.json.simple /redmine-mcp/mcp-server/config/config.json
   ```

4. **Restart the MCP server:**
   ```bash
   cd /redmine-mcp/mcp-server/
   docker-compose down
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

5. **Check the logs for connection status:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose logs -f
   ```

## Alternative: If Simple Fix Doesn't Work

If the simple approach doesn't work, consider:

1. **Network Connectivity Issue**
   - Try restarting Docker or your machine
   - Check if any firewall is blocking the connection

2. **Check Docker Configuration**
   - Ensure the Redmine service is exposed on port 3000
   - Verify it's accessible with: `curl http://localhost:3000`

3. **Alternative URL**
   - Try using `127.0.0.1` instead of `localhost` in the configuration

This approach follows MCP best practices by focusing on one task, validating each step, and keeping the solution as simple as possible.
