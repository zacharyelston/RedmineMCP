# Executive Summary: Redmine MCP Connection Issue

## Overview
The Redmine MCP server is failing to connect to the Redmine application server due to hostname resolution issues within the Docker networking environment.

## Problem Details
- **Error Message**: `Failed to connect to Redmine at http://localhost:3000`
- **Root Cause**: Configuration inconsistency in how the Docker containers resolve the hostname
- **Impact**: The MCP server cannot interact with Redmine, blocking all functionality

## Solution Implemented
We have prepared a comprehensive solution that includes:

1. **Host Alias Approach**: 
   - Adding `redmine.local` entry to `/etc/hosts` to ensure consistent hostname resolution
   - Updating configuration files to use this consistent hostname

2. **Documentation**:
   - Detailed debug report with analysis and justification
   - Step-by-step README with implementation instructions
   - Executable scripts to automate the fix process

3. **Configuration Updates**:
   - Updated MCP server configuration files
   - Modified Docker environment variables

## Implementation Plan
1. Run the `update-hosts.sh` script with sudo privileges
2. Apply configuration changes using the `fix-redmine-connection.sh` script
3. Restart both Redmine and MCP server containers
4. Verify connection using the provided validation steps

## Benefits of This Approach
- **Minimal Changes**: No major architectural changes required
- **Consistent Naming**: Eliminates confusion between different hostname references
- **Quick Implementation**: Can be deployed immediately with minimal downtime
- **Follows MCP Best Practices**: Methodical, validated approach with proper documentation

## Next Steps
1. Implement the fix on development environment
2. Validate functionality with thorough testing
3. Document the solution in the project knowledge base
4. Consider improvements to the Docker networking configuration for a more robust long-term solution

## Conclusion
The host alias approach provides a secure, reliable solution to the connection issue while following project standards and MCP best practices. The process is well-documented and can be easily implemented by the team.
