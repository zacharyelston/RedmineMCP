# Model Context Protocol (MCP) Research Summary

## Overview
The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard designed to connect AI assistants to data systems where information lives, including content repositories, business tools, and development environments. Its aim is to help frontier models produce better, more relevant responses by providing a universal, open standard for connecting AI systems with data sources, replacing fragmented integrations with a single protocol.

## Key Concepts

### Core Components
From our research, MCP provides several key components:

1. **Protocol Specification**: The core schema and rules that define how MCP components interact.
2. **Server-Client Architecture**: A standardized communication model between AI applications and data sources.
3. **SDKs**: Available in multiple languages including TypeScript, Python, Swift, Java, and Kotlin.

### Main Features
The protocol defines three fundamental primitives for adding context to language models:

- **Prompts**: Pre-defined templates or instructions that guide language model interactions
- **Resources**: Structured data or content that provides additional context to the model
- **Tools**: Executable functions that allow models to perform actions or retrieve information

### Implementation Approach
MCP can be implemented through:

1. **MCP Servers**: Lightweight programs that each expose specific capabilities through the standardized Model Context Protocol
2. **Local Data Sources**: Your computer's files, databases, and services that MCP servers can securely access
3. **Remote Services**: External systems available over the internet (e.g., through APIs) that MCP servers can connect to

## Technical Details

### Protocol Components
Based on the schema.ts file, the MCP includes:

1. **JSON-RPC Communication**: The protocol uses JSON-RPC 2.0 for communication between clients and servers.
2. **Initialization Flow**: Clients and servers establish capabilities and protocol version compatibility.
3. **Resource Management**: Methods for listing, reading, and subscribing to resources.
4. **Tool Invocation**: Framework for describing and calling tools.
5. **Prompt Templates**: System for defining and retrieving prompt templates.

### Key Data Structures
- **Resources**: Structured data or content accessed via URIs
- **Tools**: Functions that can be invoked with arguments
- **Prompts**: Templates for generating LLM interactions
- **ResourceTemplates**: Patterns for constructing resource URIs

## Available Implementations

### SDKs
MCP provides implementations in multiple languages:
- Python SDK (github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk)
- TypeScript SDK (github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk)
- Swift SDK (maintained in collaboration with @loopwork-ai)
- Java SDK (maintained in collaboration with Spring AI)
- Kotlin SDK (maintained in collaboration with JetBrains)

### Example Servers
The MCP ecosystem includes numerous server implementations for various systems:
- Code-related: code-assistant, code-executor, code-sandbox
- Content management: Contentful-mcp
- Data access: cognee-mcp (GraphRAG memory server)
- Project management: Linear (for project management, including searching, creating, and updating issues)

## Relevance to Redmine Integration

The MCP could potentially enable Redmine to:

1. **Provide Context to AI Models**: Allow AI systems to access Redmine data (issues, projects, wiki content) in a standardized way.
2. **Enable AI Tools**: Create tools that let AI models perform actions within Redmine (creating tickets, updating statuses, etc.).
3. **Create Custom Prompts**: Develop prompt templates specific to Redmine workflows and processes.

## Next Steps

1. Explore the TypeScript and/or Python SDK to understand implementation details
2. Study existing MCP server implementations for project management systems
3. Identify key Redmine data structures and interfaces that would need MCP adapters
4. Develop initial requirements for a Redmine MCP integration
