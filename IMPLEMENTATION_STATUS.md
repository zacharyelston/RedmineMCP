# RedmineMCP Implementation Status

*Note: Ideally, this file should be in a `docs/` directory.*

This document tracks the implementation status of the RedmineMCP project based on the TODO.md list.

## Project Setup Progress

✅ We have successfully set up:
- Project in Redmine with the name "RedmineMCP" and identifier "redminemcp"
- Basic issue trackers (Bug, Feature, Support)
- Issue priorities (low, medium, high)
- Time tracking activities (dev, review, waiting)

## Issues Created in Redmine

We have created the following issues in the RedmineMCP project:

1. **Create pre-configured database with trackers and required entities** (Feature, Low priority)
   - Implement a pre-configured database with trackers and required entities for simplified testing

2. **Fix tracker configuration in Redmine API testing** (Bug, High priority)
   - Fix issue #19 related to tracker configuration in Redmine API testing
   
3. **Improved Error Handling** (Feature, Medium priority)
   - Add more detailed error messages
   - Implement graceful fallbacks when APIs are unavailable
   - Create a dedicated error logging view
   
4. **User Authentication System** (Feature, High priority)
   - Add user login/registration system
   - Implement role-based permissions
   - Secure API endpoints with token authentication
   
5. **Redmine Integration Improvements** (Feature, Medium priority)
   - Support for Redmine custom fields
   - Add ability to attach files to issues
   - Integrate with Redmine wiki for documentation generation
   
6. **Test with Claude Desktop client** (Support, Low priority)
   - Complete testing of the MCP integration with the Claude Desktop client

7. **Pre-seed Redmine Database with Essentials** (Feature, High priority) ⚠️ ADDED
   - Create a script to automatically set up essential Redmine configurations:
     - Default priorities (low, medium, high)
     - Required trackers (Bug, Feature, Support)
     - Time tracking activities (dev, review, waiting)
     - Default statuses (New, In Progress, Resolved, Closed)
   - Ensure the script can be run during container initialization
   - Document the pre-seeding process for developers
   - Make Docker setup more robust by including these seeds in the initialization

## API Testing Results

We have successfully tested:
- Creating projects via the Redmine API
- Creating issues with various trackers and priorities
- Updating issues with notes and estimated hours
- Logging time on issues with different activities
- Retrieving information about issues, priorities, trackers, and statuses

## Documentation Created

We have created the following documentation:
- REDMINE_API_NOTES.md - Detailed notes on working with the Redmine API
- REDMINE_WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md - Guide for establishing workflows in Redmine
- MCP_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md - Guide for using the MCP extension with Redmine
- TROUBLESHOOTING.md - Solutions for common issues and challenges

## Next Steps

Based on our progress, the next steps are:

1. **Continue Implementing High Priority Tasks**:
   - Complete the improved error handling system
   - Implement the user authentication system
   - Develop the pre-seeding script for Redmine database essentials
   
2. **Setup for Contributors**:
   - Ensure all development scripts work correctly
   - Document the contributor workflow
   
3. **Testing and CI/CD**:
   - Implement comprehensive automated testing
   - Set up CI/CD pipelines for continuous development
   
4. **Documentation**:
   - Organize documentation in a dedicated directory
   - Create user guides for non-technical users
   
5. **Advanced Features**:
   - Implement custom field support
   - Add file attachment capabilities
   - Develop wiki integration

## Known Issues and Limitations

1. **API Limitations**:
   - No REST API endpoint for creating priorities or statuses
   - File uploads require multipart/form-data which is complex with curl
   
2. **Docker Integration**:
   - Some ARM64-specific issues need special handling
   
3. **Authentication**:
   - Currently relies on API keys; needs more robust authentication system

4. **Initial Setup Issues**:
   - Redmine requires manual configuration of essential enumerations (priorities, trackers, activities)
   - No automated way to bootstrap a complete working environment

## Conclusion

The Redmine Model Context Protocol Extension project has a solid foundation with:
- Basic functionality implemented and tested
- Key issues tracked in Redmine
- Comprehensive documentation for development

The project is well-positioned for continued development with a clear roadmap based on the TODO list priorities.
