    text: "h1. RedmineMCP Project Overview\n\nh2. Current Project Status\n\nThe RedmineMCP project is currently in Phase 1: Research and Planning. The project aims to integrate the Model Context Protocol (MCP) with Redmine, enabling AI assistants to interact with Redmine data and functionality in a standardized way.\n\nCore components implemented so far:\n* Basic MCP server structure (mcp.py)\n* Comprehensive Redmine API client (redmine_api.py)\n* File-based configuration approach\n* Docker containerization setup\n\nh2. Project Structure\n\nThe project is organized into phases with parent-child issue relationships:\n\n* *MCP Server Architecture* (Parent Issue #1)\n** Research: MCP Server Architectures (#12)\n** POC: Basic MCP Server Implementation (#13)\n* *Redmine API Integration* (Parent Issue #2)\n** Research: Redmine API Capabilities and Limitations (#14)\n** POC: Redmine API Client Prototype (#15)\n* *Resource Handling* (Parent Issue #3)\n** Research: MCP Resource Models and Templates (#16)\n** POC: Basic Resource Handler Implementation (#17)\n* *Tool Implementation* (Parent Issue #4)\n** Research: MCP Tool Specifications and Implementation Patterns (#18)\n** POC: Tool Handler with Basic Action Implementation (#19)\n* *Prompt Templates* (Parent Issue #5)\n** Research: MCP Prompt Templates and Variables (#20)\n** POC: Basic Prompt Template Implementation (#21)\n* *Testing Framework* (Parent Issue #6)\n** Research: Testing Frameworks and Methodologies (#22)\n** POC: Test Framework Setup and Basic Tests (#23)\n* *Integration Testing* (Parent Issue #7)\n** Research: Integration Testing Strategies for MCP (#24)\n** POC: Integration Testing Environment (#25)\n* *Documentation* (Parent Issue #8)\n** Research: Documentation Standards and Tools (#26)\n** POC: Documentation Framework and Templates (#27)\n* *Docker Implementation* (Parent Issue #9)\n** Research: Docker Best Practices for MCP Servers (#28)\n** POC: Basic Docker Container Setup (#29)\n* *Security Implementation* (Parent Issue #10)\n** Research: Security Best Practices for MCP Servers (#30)\n** POC: Security Controls Implementation (#31)\n* *Monitoring and Operations* (Parent Issue #11)\n** Research: Monitoring Solutions for MCP Servers (#32)\n** POC: Basic Monitoring Implementation (#33)\n\nh2. Development Process\n\nOur development process emphasizes:\n\n* **Planning & Process over Implementation**: We focus on establishing solid processes first\n* **File-based Configuration**: Using YAML files instead of databases for portability\n* **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit and integration tests for all components\n* **Security-first Design**: Secure handling of credentials and API access\n* **Documentation**: In-line with code and comprehensive wiki documentation\n\nh2. Recommended Next Steps\n\nThe recommended next issue to prioritize is:\n\n**Issue #23: POC: Test Framework Setup and Basic Tests**\n\nRationale for this priority:\n\n1. Establishing a testing framework early will ensure all subsequent implementations can be properly tested and verified\n2. Several other POC implementations are planned that would benefit from having a testing framework in place first\n3. The corresponding research task (issue #22) appears to be ready for implementation\n4. Focus on \"planning & process over implementing\" aligns with setting up testing early\n5. The redmine_api.py file is substantial and would benefit from thorough testing before more features are built on top of it\n\nh3. Implementation Plan for Issue #23\n\n1. **Create Test Directory Structure**\n```\n/tests/\n├── unit/\n│   ├── test_redmine_api.py\n│   ├── test_mcp.py\n│   └── test_config.py\n├── integration/\n│   ├── test_redmine_integration.py\n│   └── test_mcp_endpoints.py\n├── conftest.py  # For shared fixtures\n└── README.md    # Testing documentation\n```\n\n2. **Set Up pytest Framework**\n   - Create a pytest.ini file with configuration\n   - Set up fixtures for mocking Redmine API responses\n   - Implement test helper utilities\n\n3. **Implement Initial Unit Tests**\n   - Focus on redmine_api.py and mcp.py core functionality\n   - Implement test coverage for error handling scenarios\n   - Create mock data for test cases\n\n4. **Set Up CI Configuration**\n   - Create a simple GitHub Actions workflow file\n   - Configure automated test runs on commits\n\n5. **Document Testing Approach**\n   - Create a testing strategy document\n   - Document test fixtures and helpers\n   - Establish guidelines for writing new tests\n\nh2. Key Files and Locations\n\n* **API Guide**: `REDMINE_API_GUIDE.md`\n* **Developer Diary**: `DEVELOPER_DIARY.md`\n* **Requirements**: `02_requirements/requirements_specification.md`\n* **Core MCP Server**: `mcp.py`\n* **Redmine API Client**: `redmine_api.py`\n\nh2. Technical Debt and Future Considerations\n\nAreas that need attention in future phases:\n\n1. **Testing Infrastructure**: Currently limited, needs comprehensive implementation\n2. **Handling Large Responses**: May need optimization for very large LLM responses\n3. **Error Handling Consistency**: Some API endpoints have more robust error handling than others\n4. **Configuration Validation**: Add more validation for configuration parameters"
