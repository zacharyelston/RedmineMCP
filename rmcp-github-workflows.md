# GitHub Workflows Implementation Plan

## Overview
Add GitHub Actions workflows to mirror GitLab CI/CD pipeline and implement bi-directional synchronization between GitHub and GitLab repositories.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Main CI/CD Pipeline
Implemented a GitHub Actions workflow that mirrors the existing GitLab CI/CD pipeline with the following stages:
- Install dependencies
- Lint code
- Build project
- Run tests
- Test subproject creation (manual trigger)

### 2. GitHub to GitLab Sync
Created a workflow that synchronizes changes from GitHub to GitLab:
- Triggers on pushes to main/master branch
- Uses Git commands to push changes to GitLab
- Requires GitLab credentials as GitHub secrets

### 3. GitLab to GitHub Sync
Implemented a workflow for synchronizing from GitLab to GitHub:
- Runs on a schedule (every 6 hours)
- Can be manually triggered
- Creates a pull request for review before merging changes
- Requires both GitLab and GitHub credentials

### 4. Documentation
Added a README.md file in the .github directory explaining:
- Available workflows
- Required secrets
- Usage instructions
- Manual trigger options

## Required Secrets
To use these workflows, the following secrets must be configured:
- `GITLAB_URL`: The URL of the GitLab repository
- `GITLAB_TOKEN`: GitLab Personal Access Token
- `GITLAB_PROJECT_ID`: GitLab project ID
- `SYNC_GITHUB_TOKEN`: GitHub Personal Access Token

## Testing Plan
1. Verify main CI/CD pipeline by pushing a minor change
2. Test GitHub to GitLab sync with a simple commit
3. Manually trigger GitLab to GitHub sync and verify pull request creation
4. Review logs to ensure all steps complete successfully

## Future Enhancements
1. Add notifications for failed synchronization
2. Implement custom status checks
3. Consider adding deployment workflows for automated releases
