## Risk Management

### Identified Risks

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Redmine API changes | High | Low | Version specific implementation, regular API monitoring |
| MCP protocol updates | Medium | Medium | Modular design, protocol version support |
| Performance bottlenecks | High | Medium | Early performance testing, caching strategies |
| Security vulnerabilities | High | Low | Regular security reviews, follow best practices |
| Resource constraints | Medium | Medium | Clear prioritization, phased implementation |

### Contingency Plan
- Two-week buffer built into timeline
- Core functionality prioritized over enhancements
- Regular milestone reviews to assess progress
- Scalable implementation to allow for phased delivery

## Resource Allocation

### Development Team
