# RedmineMCP Integration Project Plan

## Project Overview
This project aims to integrate the Model Context Protocol (MCP) into Redmine, enabling better context management for AI models within the Redmine project management system.

## Process Framework
Our approach follows a systematic process that emphasizes repeatability and security:

1. **Research Phase** (2-3 weeks)
   - Deep analysis of MCP specification
   - Redmine architecture exploration
   - Integration patterns identification
   - Technology compatibility assessment

2. **Requirements Phase** (2 weeks)
   - Functional requirements definition
   - Non-functional requirements specification
   - Integration points mapping
   - User story development
   - Acceptance criteria establishment

3. **Design Phase** (2-3 weeks)
   - System architecture design
   - Interface specifications
   - Data flow diagrams
   - Sequence diagrams
   - Component design

4. **Implementation Planning** (1-2 weeks)
   - Work breakdown structure
   - Task sequencing
   - Resource allocation
   - Timeline development
   - Risk management plan

5. **Documentation** (Ongoing)
   - Technical specifications
   - Integration guides
   - User documentation
   - Process documentation
